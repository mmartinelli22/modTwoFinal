<head>What does this program do?</head>
<h1>This program builds a basic hotel booking app using vanilla javascript, html and css. It utilizes fetch calls to grab data  from a server, and integrates a login page, something not used before.</h1>

TECHNOLOGIES USED
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>


How can I make it work?
<h2>Clone down the repo by clicking the green Code button, and then copying the link under SSH.
In your terminal, type in git clone and then paste the copied link.
Once you have cloned the repo, change ( cd ) into the directory and install the project dependencies, by running npm install.
Run npm start in the terminal, and copy the URL link (http://localhost:8080/) to see the HTML page
Now that you have that visit this GitHub and clone it down into a seperate folder outside of the one you previously cloned.
Then, CD into the folder and run npm install and then npm start
No need to copy and paste an address for this.
The website should be functioning now!
To stop running the server, use Control + C in the terminal. (Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems.) </h2>

<h2>How to log in</h2>
<li>To log in, you need to put in customer(customerId 1-50) as the username</li>
<li>The password is overlook2021</li>


<h2>How to use the app</h2>
<p1>To use the app, you start off by inputing a date into the calendar, then pressing the 'Search for bookings' button. Afterwards, if there are bookings on that day, they will show up in the middle of the page, and a dropdown will appear. On that drop down, there will be the roomtypes, click on one you'd like to find, click search and you will now be displayed with all rooms with that booking type that are available on that date. Simply hit add to bookings, and you will have it added to your current bookings</p1>


<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p1>I was met with many challenges during this. Some of the biggest were integrating a way to make the DOM update my costs when I would add a filtered booking. Also, styling took a lot more time than I'd like to admit, I spent a good four or five hours trying to get filtered bookings to be styled neatly on the DOM. Also, making sure my html is specific so it can be tabbed through was a bit of a hastle, but I got it to work. Now the program will pass the lighthouse audit with a 98.</p1>
