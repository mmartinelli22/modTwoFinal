//How can I make it work?
<h2>Clone down the repo by clicking the green Code button, and then copying the link under SSH.
In your terminal, type in git clone and then paste the copied link.
Once you have cloned the repo, change ( cd ) into the directory and install the project dependencies, by running npm install.
Run npm start in the terminal, and copy the URL link (http://localhost:8080/) to see the HTML page
Now that you have that visit this GitHub and clone it down into a seperate folder outside of the one you previously cloned.
Then, CD into the folder and run npm install and then npm start
No need to copy and paste an address for this.
The website should be functioning now!
To stop running the server, use Control + C in the terminal. (Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems.) </h2>

Simply hit add to bookings, and you will have it added to your current bookings</p1>
